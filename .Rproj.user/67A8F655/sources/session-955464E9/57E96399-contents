Other columns contain additional filter criteria, like:

  + median_AB: a median (robust) reference allele ratio estimate in case you want to play it extra safe in retaining significantly biased loci
  + quality: will contain "!" if a locus contained no heterozygous samples to detect AB on
  + "allele.frequency": referring to the reference allele frequency across genotypes; you may not want to trust loci with extreme allele frequencies     as these probably contain very little heterozygous individuals
  + "coverage": contains the median coverage of all samples covering the locus)
  + "nr_samples": number of samples covering the locus
